# Python Library Notes

This repository contains my personal Jupyter Notebook notes created while learning different Python libraries (mainly from YouTube tutorials).  
Each notebook is a self-contained reference with explanations, examples, and experiments.

## Structure
- Each folder/notebook corresponds to one Python library.
- Notes include basic usage, important functions, and small projects/demos when relevant.

## Purpose
- Serve as a quick reference for revisiting libraries.
- Track learning progress over time.
- Open for others who want concise, practical notes.

## Libraries covered (* work in progress)
1. JSON
2. Matplotlib
3. Pandas*
4. Seaborn
5. Webscraping using BeautifulSoup and Requests
